For tomorrow morning:
- Add loop inside the training loop for each datafile DONE
- Run the model on two datasets DONE
- Run the model on more datasets
- Establish a technique for data augmentation
- Produce function to visualize i^th slice for looking inside 3D block
- Establish definition of function for evaluation of the divergence of the stress
- Produce function to visualize the divergence of the stress from the model
- Produce a function to compare the divergence of the stress from the model with the divergence of the stress from the data
